# Customer Management System (Screenshots)
##  Customer Management System is my second year project in my faculty for applying some of topics that I learned in this year like data structures and algorithms that there is an ArrayList is built in the project, heapsort for sorting and binary search for searchung. and databases subject that this project connects with a MySql database and insert, read, update, and delete data

## Home Page

## Default List
### The code collect all the customers from the database and set them in an ArrayList that is built in the project and view the rom the arrylist to a table view
<div>
  <img src="screenshots/default list.png" />
</div>
<br>
<br>

## The list sorted based id
### The code sort all the elements in the ArryList using an HeapSort Algorithm which is built in also
<div>
  <img src="screenshots/sorted list based id.png" />
</div>
<br>
<br>

## The list sorted based name
### Using the HeapSort Algorithm also
<div>

</div>
<br>
<br>

## Search in the list using id
### Using Binary Search algorithm which is built in the ArrayList
<div>
  <img src="screenshots/search id.png" />
</div>
<br>
<br>

## Search in the list using phone number
### Using Binary Search
